    <div class="container blog-desc-content">
        <p>Despite my deep affection for cheese, to the point that one of my favorite things to do on a New York City
            weekend is to dip into Murray’s and treat us to something crumbly or aged or rich and runny, I don’t love
            cheese
            plates. It feels really good to get this off my chest. At first, it was just a budget issue; I still feel
            the
            sticker shock from the first time I tried to put together one of those cute boards with five or six
            different
            wedges on them, plus the crackers, breads, pickles, dried fruit, toasted almonds, olives, cured meats, and
            all
            of the other minimum requirements of our latter-day horns of plenty. But I was also put off by the waste.
            Even
            though so much went unfinished, the leftovers were unsalvageable, as fingers, forks, knives, and crumbs got
            into
            everything (a particularly shuddering thought in the age of Covid). Instead, when people come over, or what
            I
            remember of it, I prefer to focus on one or two decadent, attention-grabbing things and nothing grabs
            attention
            on a cold winter day like warm, runny cheese.</p>
        <p>
            Baked brie was all the entertaining rage in the 1970s and 80s. Nothing was more glamorous but accessible, an
            imported cheese that everyone knew and could pronounce. But as Americans got more sophisticated about
            imported cheese — manchego! Humboldt Fog! — in a crushing fall from grace, brie became the opposite of chic.
            And this is where my interest piqued — dated and unhip, you say? Where can I sign up?
